## Introduction to React

It seems like React components are returning HTML markup. However, this is not the case. The layout of React components is mostly written using JSX. Although JSX looks like HTML, we are actually dealing with a way to write JavaScript. Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript.

After compiling, our application looks like this:

    const App = () => {
      const now = new Date()
      const a = 10
      const b = 20
      return React.createElement(
        'div',
        null,
        React.createElement(
          'p', null, 'Hello world, it is ', now.toString()
        ),
        React.createElement(
          'p', null, a, ' plus ', b, ' is ', a + b
        )
      )
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
      React.createElement(App, null),
      document.getElementById('root')
    )

Writing components with React is easy, and by combining components, even a more complex application can be kept fairly maintainable. Indeed, a core philosophy of React is composing applications from many specialized reusable components.

Because the root element is stipulated, we have "extra" div-elements in the DOM-tree. This can be avoided by using fragments, i.e. by wrapping the elements to be returned by the component with an empty element:

    const App = () => {
      const name = 'Peter'
      const age = 10

      return (
        <>
          <h1>Greetings</h1>
          <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
          <Hello name={name} age={age} />
          <Footer />
        </>
      )
    }

## Javascript

## Component state, event handlers

## A more complex state, debugging React apps
